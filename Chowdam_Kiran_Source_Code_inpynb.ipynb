        "\n",
        "The hospitality industry has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of online platforms facilitating short-term lodging and tourism. Leading this revolution is Airbnb, Inc., a pioneering American company that has reshaped travel accommodation through its innovative online marketplace. Established in 2008 in San Francisco, California, Airbnb provides a diverse range of lodging options, offering guests a unique and personalized experience. Unlike traditional hospitality providers, Airbnb operates on a commission-based model, facilitating transactions between hosts and guests without owning the properties listed on its platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "This research analysis delves into the New York City Airbnb dataset to extract meaningful insights. Through rigorous data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization techniques, the study aims to illuminate the dynamics of the city's lodging market. By discerning factors influencing listing availability, pricing strategies, and overall customer satisfaction, the research contributes to a deeper understanding of Airbnb's operations in one of the world's most dynamic urban environments. These insights hold significance for stakeholders and enthusiasts seeking to navigate the evolving landscape of short-term accommodation..\n",

        "\n",
        "This project is aimed to uncover some insights from the Airbnb Open Data. The following questions would be answered from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What are the different property types in the Dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Which neighborhood group has the highest number of listings?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Which neighborhoods group have the highest average prices for Airbnb listings?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Is there a relationship between the construction year of property and price?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Who are the top 10 hosts by calculated host listing count?\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Are hosts with verified identities more likely to receive positive reviews?\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Is there a correlation between the price of a listing and its service fee?\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the average review rate number (e.g., stars) for listings, and does it vary based on the neighborhood group and room type?\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Are hosts with a higher calculated host listings count more likely to maintain higher availability throughout the year?"

        "- Number of reviews and review rate number: Social proof tends to increase demand; listings with more reviews and higher ratings attract more bookings.\n",
        "- Availability 365: Lower availability often indicates higher occupancy (higher demand), though host blocking can confound it.\n",
        "- Minimum nights: Higher minimums can reduce demand except for extended-stay segments.\n",
